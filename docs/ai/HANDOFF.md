# Frigo AI Handoff — isolated T09 development

## Current T09 handoff — 2026-09-10

Program: Inventory Truth Layer
Task: T09 — Inventory Lot Engine & Event Authority
Phase: T09D complete and published; E–H pending
Status: IN_PROGRESS
Canonical Repository: vn-2b/frigo-dev (user-confirmed correction)
Canonical Branch: hoplite/euhesperides-d77023a5
T08 Base SHA: 8f8788c1a0c9e486657751ef3875a5baa5334dec
Last Verified Remote SHA: b036b257a8ad775dd6f1a445dcfdcce38a6babf1
T09D Code Checkpoint: b036b257a8ad775dd6f1a445dcfdcce38a6babf1
Development Main Anchor: d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa
Application Freeze: NOT FROZEN

Completed: identity/baseline/publication-first; T09A audit/lifecycle; B contracts;
C internal native executor, additive 0024, membership/revision/CAS, receipt/event/
projection atomicity and actual local D1 proof. No HTTP or legacy-writer cutover;
unadopted/mixed households fail ADOPTION_REQUIRED rather than silently diverge.
Checks: native/combined/full regression gates, static/build, 24-migration replay,
populated upgrade and local D1 proof run; exact current counts in
inventory-truth/t09/VERIFICATION.md. Final C: 507 focused / 1,994 full (93 files),
lint/typecheck/build, 24-migration/local schema PASS. Remote-source 507 PASS.
Failure: managed setup claim blocked; workaround succeeded, platform issue filed.
D now rejects corrupt retained receipts, invalid command event binding and paired
receipt/event evidence inconsistent with written stock. Additive 0025/0026 retain
all earlier migrations and historical events. D final checks: 1,031 focused,
2,518 full / 95 files, lint/typecheck/build, 26-migration replay and local schema
PASS. Review findings and exact commands: inventory-truth/t09/VERIFICATION.md.
Full T09 E–H completion gates pending. Historical counts below are not
T09 evidence. Preserved unrelated settings overlay in named local stash; details
in inventory-truth/t09/SESSION_LOG.md. No tracked setup configuration changes.
Publication: D b036b25 committed/published/fetched; local/remote equality PASS.
Separate fetched-source worktree: 1,031 tests and typecheck PASS, clean source.
Exact Next Action: T09E deterministic FEFO, then F explicit adoption/all-writer
integration before exposing HTTP. No remaining D check failure. This documentation
receipt follows the verified code SHA; resolve latest docs HEAD via Git.
Read inventory-truth/t09/REVIEW_INDEX.md. T09 is not independent-review-ready.
Legacy Frigo/main/production/staging/remote D1/PayOS untouched; T10 not started.

## Historical handoff (not current task authority)

## Current branch handoff — published T08 completion (2026-09-10)

Repository vn-2c/Frigo. User explicitly approved the Hoplite publication branch
instead of the original canonical name; DEC-006 supersedes only that restriction.

Program: Inventory Truth Layer
Task: T08
Phase: T08F Verification/Handoff
Status: COMPLETE — verified, committed and published; not deployed
Canonical Branch: hoplite/xanthos-7d942897 (user-approved cross-account handoff)
Base Main / last fetched origin/main: d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa
Last Code SHA: dd2ecc6f7066250dfdc5214a3d6c356e1479b61e
Last Verified / Confirmed Published SHA: fb00f46d4633c9659e812be9f86119533973a8bd
Final HEAD: subsequent docs-only checkpoint; read `git rev-parse HEAD`

Completed: audit; strict storage/lot contracts; additive 0023; exact milli-unit
adapter; explicit guarded/idempotent backfill; compatibility projection/parity.
Fresh final-session verification: 130 focused tests; 1,617 full tests / 89 files;
lint, typecheck, build, 23-migration replay/local schema and diff checks PASS.
Prior sandbox-local D1 apply also passed 23/23. No remaining failure; publication
succeeded through the trusted broker and its exact head was fetched/confirmed.

Remaining T08 work: none. Exact next action: next account checks out
`origin/hoplite/xanthos-7d942897`, reads `inventory-truth/T08_VERIFICATION.md` and
the six handoff files, then waits for explicit T09 authorization.
Do not force-push, merge/rebase main, deploy or touch remote D1/PayOS.
Quantity that cannot fit exact milli-units fails preflight unchanged. Legacy data
is not live-synced; unknown/estimated evidence stays distinct and guest transfer
drift is diagnostic, not an auth rewrite. T09 owns commands/event authority/dual-write.

Cross-account takeover: first read the six `inventory-truth/` documents in order;
diff Last Verified SHA..HEAD. Exact executed commands, corrected failures, source
map and future integration risks are persisted there, not dependent on this chat.
Branch pushed: YES. Main/production/staging/remote D1/PayOS untouched: YES.

PREVIOUS DOCS-CLEANUP DEPLOY WORKFLOW: `34405457796 SUCCESS`

PRODUCTION: **NOT DEPLOYED**

## Current status

T01-T07: COMPLETE

Release Integration: **COMPLETE**

Main Integration: **COMPLETE**

GitHub source of truth: main.

APPLICATION INTEGRATION: complete in main at `23ef51d6ec12a5a3e319a2d941dca39d2775cb9d`.

The main merge tree is source-equivalent to the verified release head. Changes
after the production application base are documentation-only.

## Verification receipt

- Full: 1,487 tests / 87 files PASS.
- Focused T02-T07: 819 tests / 40 files PASS.
- D1 clean: 22 / 22 migrations PASS.
- Upgrade sanity: 0020 -> 0022 PASS.
- Existing rows preserved: 776 rows / 58 tables.
- Browser: 264 assertions / 36 phases PASS.
- Payment-adjacent: 82 tests / 7 files PASS.
- Final release CI: PASS.

These are preserved application gates and were not rerun during this docs-only
reconciliation. The previous documentation cleanup PR's hosted checks passed;
this correction PR will receive its own hosted check.

## Deployment and production boundary

Release packaging completed. Staging was not provisioned, so no staging deploy
occurred; staging build, deploy and smoke steps were skipped. Production job was
skipped and production deployment was not performed.

PRODUCTION LOCAL RECONCILIATION NOT STARTED

Production local reconciliation: NOT STARTED

PRODUCTION DATABASE MIGRATION NOT PERFORMED

Production DB migration: NOT PERFORMED

PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT NOT PERFORMED

Production deployment: NOT PERFORMED

Planner rollout: NOT STARTED. Checked-in planner/UI/AI safe defaults remain
according to rollout policy; live production values and secrets were not
inspected.

## PR #8 authoritative metadata

PR #8 METADATA:

- State: `MERGED`
- Draft: `false`
- Merged at: `2026-09-09T19:38:59Z`
- Closed at: `2026-09-09T19:38:59Z`
- Merge commit: `23ef51d6ec12a5a3e319a2d941dca39d2775cb9d`
- Base: `main`
- Head: `hoplite/kirrha-5f4057f0`
- Head SHA: `0420807968538f61b669569d064c404f67032174`

PR #8 was not reopened, re-merged or modified during this task. Its verified
release tree is already contained in main. Application integration and PR
metadata are separate facts.

## Kirrha archival state

Kirrha is two commits ahead of current main and differs only in the four
`docs/ai/` release protocol documents. It has no application differences absent
from main. Do not merge or revert this historical branch.

## Protected areas

PayOS/payment code untouched.

No real payment performed.

## Next task

Next task: PRODUCTION-LOCAL RECONCILIATION

Do NOT git pull/reset directly inside running production. Production-local source
must first be snapshotted and compared against the final post-merge GitHub main
head, with
application lineage anchored at `PRODUCTION_APPLICATION_BASE_SHA`. Do not deploy,
run remote migrations, enable planner flags or alter production configuration as
part of this bookkeeping task. Do not treat `PRE_CLEANUP_MAIN_HEAD` as the final
head.
